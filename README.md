## VAC.
Launch the game with "-insecure" start flag, just incase.
It's unclear wether or not the VAC module is enabled/disabled.

## Menu
When injected; Press "INSERT" to open the menu.
If the menu doesn't show up, NOR the console text, you should look and see if you have the latest
C++ Redistrutable installed.

## Thanks
